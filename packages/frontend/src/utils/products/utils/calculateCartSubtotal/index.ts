/**
 * Order of operations for cart subtotal calculation:
 *
 * 1. Calculate total price of products using their 'current' values, i.e. - their variant-level
 *    discounts are already priced in.
 * 2. Apply subscription discounts for applicable items.
 * 3. Using the current subtotal of the cart, apply promotions (as long as each one meets their
 *    specified threshold values) - DO NOT recalculate the subtotal after each promotion is applied:
 *    3a. Subtract fixed-amount promotions first (e.g. - Â£10 off).
 *    3a. Subtract percentage promotions last (e.g. - 10% off).
 * 4. Using the current subtotal of the cart, apply postage cost if applicable.
